This weekend we went shopping at Chennai Silks, a seven-story store dedicated to silk and cotton garmentware. The selection was overwhelming: thousands of printed and woven fabrics in a variety of designs, from blouses to scarves to sarees.

With some help (from 5 enthusiastic associates), Ashley found a beautiful new silk saree.
