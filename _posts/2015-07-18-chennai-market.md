On Saturday we stopped by one of Chennai's fish markets, where we encountered an incredible variety of local fish and shellfish. We were there just to see and observe, and had no intention of purchasing anything. This decision was quickly affirmed once we saw the thick clouds of flies surrounding the fish (though hardly visible in our photos).

It was interesting to watch the fishmongers descale and portion their fish with what appeared to be dull knives. This meant for a rather messy work station.
