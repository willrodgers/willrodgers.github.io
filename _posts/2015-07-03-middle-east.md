The descent into Abu Dhabi was incredible - a brief glimpse of the Persian Gulf, followed by seemingly endless desert, and then suddenly an oasis of modern buildings. The airport contained a diverse mix of travelers, though most prominent were Arab men wearing traditional the Kandorah (robe) and Igal (headdress).

I had just enough time to stop for a cup of Arabic coffee, which was strong and delicious. Unsurprisingly, there was a McDonalds in the airport here. I opted not to try the Chicken Big Mac.
