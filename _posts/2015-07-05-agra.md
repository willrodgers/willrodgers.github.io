From Delhi we headed 130 miles southeast to Agra, home of the Taj Mahal. Our first stop upon arrival was Agra Fort, another walled city and palace for Mughal emperors built with the same distinctive red sandstone.

From the top of the palace we had our first glimpse of the Taj Mahal across the river. We couldn't wait to visit it the next day!
