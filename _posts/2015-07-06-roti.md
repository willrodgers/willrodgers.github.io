As we entered Rajasthan on our trip between Agra and Jaipur today, we decided to stop at a small roadside cafe for a snack. A special on the menu was Rajasthani roti, a thinner version of naan made from un-leavened whole grain wheat flour. It was warm and delicious!

To our surprise, the locals invited us out behind the cafe to demonstrate the traditional cooking method of roti, over a small open flame - a fascinating process to watch!
