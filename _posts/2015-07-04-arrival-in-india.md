Ashely and I have arrived in Chennai! We took opposite paths around the globe (with Ash hitting Hong Kong and Singapore), but we managed to arrive in Chennai within 30 minutes of each other. (Pro-tip for future travelers: the e-tourist visa line in the airport had no wait time at all, compared to a 25+ minute wait for everyone else going through traditional visa processing). We didn't make it to our hotel until near midnight, but fortunately one of the hotel restaurants was still open and we stopped for some fresh naan (picture above).

The hotel here is wonderful - I'm looking forward to returning here for my extended stay. At the buffet breakfast this morning we discovered our new favorite Indian dish - Marsala Dosa, which is a rice-flour based crepe stuffed with a potato/onion stew, served with a spicy red pepper chutney. It was so delicious we ordered a second plate!

This evening we fly to Delhi to start our tour of the Golden Triangle. Stay tuned!
