For the last part of our trip, we flew 1,300 miles south to a region of India called Kerala, known by locals as "God's own country". It was a beautiful, mountainous countryside, filled with some of India's largest tea and spice plantations. In fact, over 60% of India's cardamom spice is produced here. In the photos above and below, you can see the faint lines of rows of tea plants, part of a plantation belonging to the Tata Global Beverage group (producers of Tetley tea).

The monsoon was in full effect during our stay, which meant frequent rains. The balcony of our hotel overlooked a beautiful mountain valley full of tea plants; however, during most of our stay it was blanketed by thick clouds.

In between rainstorms, we took a hanging basket ride over a small tea plantation. Tea plants are surprisingly versatile in growing on steep inclines, which is a necessity in this hilly region.

Because of the heavy rainfall, waterfalls were abundant. We passed by dozens during our stay.
